## Contingency table, statistics and independence

Here we will present a first study about Contingency Table, and observe if the classes belonging to the table are independent or not, that means: - are they independent or not? The statistics that we will use is the chi-square statistics, or better, chi-square hypothesis test.

### ROC: sensitivity x specificity
  
## Two distributions - t-student test (t.test)

Here we will present 2 distributions and makey them close togheter or far appart to observe the sensitivity, specificity and to calculate the ROC.
