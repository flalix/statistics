## Contingency table, statistics and independence

Here we will present a first study about Contingency Table. The classes belonging to the table are compared, and we will infer it they are independent. The statistics that will be used is the chi-square statistics, and also the chi-square hypothesis test.

### ROC: sensitivity x specificity
  
## Two distributions - t-student test (t.test)

Here we will present 2 distributions and make them close togheter or far appart to observe the sensitivity, specificity and to calculate the ROC (receiver operating curve)
